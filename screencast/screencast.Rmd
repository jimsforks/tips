# How to make a screen cast movie in PowerPoint

## Mac warning

Note this from [UWMilwaukee](https://kb.uwm.edu/uwmhd/page.php?id=55888).

The workaround:

> Since recording audio over slides in PowerPoint for Mac
> **is not supported**, this article details how to use QuickTime to do
> a screen recording of a PowerPoint presentation with audio recorded
> from the internal microphone.

- Open Quicktime

- Go to the file menu and select "New Screen Recording"

- The Screen recording window will open

- Click on the down arrow next to the record button and select the
  microphone as the Internal Microphone
  
- Click the record button. Drag to record the part of the screen.
  End recording by clicking the stop button in the menu bar.
  
- Once the recording starts, start the Power Point presentation and
  speak as needed during reporting.
  
- Once recording is completed, click the stop button on the menu bar.
  A window will come up. Go to File and click Save. Save the file to
  your desk top.
  
**This** is why I needed to render on the PC!!!


## PC ideas

1. Make a PowerPoint template that you like. **Simple** is better.    
   Less is more...
   I have an example I like in `john_blue_theme.potx`

2. Prepare each slide. Each slide should let you make **one point**.
   You have been preparing for a long time. You know the flow of your
   argument. The audience doesn't. Use the the slide to bring them along
   in your flow of your argument (logical flow of ideas.)

3. Write a narration for each slide in your favorite text editor. This
   will be your script when you record audio.

4. Record the audio for each slide. Note the red arrow pointing to the
   audio icon. I dragged it out of the frame. If you don't like the
   audio recording, delete it and record again.

5. When done, render the `.mp4` video.
