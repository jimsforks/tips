# Introduction

`BadgerFilm` is a program developed by Aurelien Moi and John Fournelle
to do thin film quantification from X-ray EDS and Electron Microprobe Spectra
from thin films on a substrate.

It is a successor to the `GMRFilm` package by Richard Waldo at General Motors
in the 1980s.

`BadgerFilm` is Open Source and is written in Visual Basic and hosted on
[github](https://github.com/Aurelien354/BadgerFilm). The developers note: 

> BadgeFilm requires a Windows OS (or emulator) and the
> .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher version.

There is a `Quick Start` guide
[here](https://github.com/Aurelien354/BadgerFilm/blob/master/BadgerFilm%20v1.2%20quickstart.docx).

I have  local archives in the "Documentation" sub directory.
