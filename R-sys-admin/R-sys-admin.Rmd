# R Systems Administration for Windows

## R-3.5.1

I am including this tip because of the problem finding RTools in R-4.0.0 beta

Mara Averick posted a solution for being unable to find RTools
[here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rtools-not-recognized-r3-5-1-rtools-3-5/11311).

## R-3.6.3

Date: 2020-04-18 

`R-3.6.3` is the last release on the R-3.6 version. I am currently running
this on my Windows computers anticipating the release of R-4.0.0.

1. I like to install R in `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3`.

- I edit `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3/etc/i386/Makeconf` adding \
  `BINPREF ?= C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/`
  
-  I edit `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3/etc/x64/Makeconf` adding \
   `BINPREF ?= C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/`

2. I like to install Rtools in `C:/Apps/R/Rtools`


On 2020-04-19 on jrmSimulationPC

```

```



## Preparing for R-4.0.0

### Saving a list of packages

An interesting idea from `@dailyzad` on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dailyzad/status/1253506170372980737).

1. Save your packages and versions by:

    ```
    ip <- installed.packages()
    saveRDS(ip, "path/to/current_packages.rds")
    ```

2. After re-installing base R

    ```
    ip <- readRDS(ip, "path/to/current_packages.rds")
    install.packages(ip[,1])
    ```
    
    This will re-install your packages. This might work well for a re-install
    on a new computer, but doesn't make a lot of sense for a major distribution
    update...
    


## Fun with RTools 4.0 on Windows 10

1. Create an alias to the `mingw64.exe` 64 bit shell program
and move it to the desktop or menu and use this to launch
the correct shell.

2. Update Rtools 4.0 periodically using

![Joren's example](inc/joren_shell.png)

Copy and paste from the line below...

<font size="5">
pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-curl
</font>


## Getting R-4.0.0 to find RTools

From [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) The whole page is 
helpful. This had me pulling hair... For days... **Finally**, here is the
solution:

> After the installation is completed, you need to perform one more step to be
> able to compile R packages: you need to put the location of the rtools make
> utilities (bash, make, etc) on the PATH. The easiest way to do so is create a
> text file .Renviron in your Documents folder which contains the following
> line:
> 
> ```
> PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"
> ```
>
> You can do this with a text editor, or you can even do it from R like so:
>
> ## Automatically put Rtools on the PATH
>
> `writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")`
>
> Now restart R and verify that make can be found, which should show the path to
> your rtools installation. If this works you can try to install an R package
> from source:
>
> ## Confirm that make.exe is on the PATH
>
> ```
> Sys.which("make")
> "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"
> ```
> 
> ## Try to install a package
>
> ```
> install.packages("jsonlite", type = "source")
> ```
> If this succeeds, you’re good!



# R Systems Administration for MacOS

Note: I could switch versions using Bob Rudis'
[Rswitch](https://rud.is/rswitch/).

## R-3.6.3

This information was entered on 2020-04-19

```
> .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library"
```

## R-4.0.0

This version uses `XCode` and an installed `gfortran` package. A helpful
website was

[The Coatless Professor](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/)

I archived the key information below


### INTRO

The objective behind this post is to provide users with information on how to
setup the macOS toolchain for compiling used in the 4.y.z series of R. The post
is structured primarily for macOS Catalina (10.15.z) users.

### REMOVING OLD INSTALLATION FILES

If you previously used either the clang4, clang6, clang7, clang8, or the
macos-rtools installer, please consider deleting the old components that
were installed.

Instructions for uninstallation can be found here:

[Uninstalling the R development toolchain on macOS](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r/uninstalling-the-r-development-toolchain-on-macos)

That said, please remove both `~/.R/Makevar`s and `~/.Renviron` files prior
to continuing as they were set in a prior iteration. You can achieve this by
using:

```
unlink("~/.R/Makevars")
unlink("~/.Renviron")
```

Alternatively, if there is contents inside of the `~/.Renviron` file that must
be retained, please look for where the `PATH` variable is listed and
**remove any part** with `clang`.

Open the file in R using:

```
file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

Next, find and remove:

```
PATH="/usr/local/clang7/bin:${PATH}"
```

Then, save and close the file. You may need to restart R for the changes to
take effect.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

One of the primary ways to setup the R toolchain for compiled code on macOS
is to individually installing each element yourself.

There are two components to the R 4.y.z toolchain based on
Section: C.3 macOS of
[R Installation and Administration](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#macOS).

These components are:

- `Xcode Command Line Tools` ("Xcode CLI")
- gfortran    
  gfortran 6.3: Sierra (10.12) and High Sierra (10.13)    
  gfortran 8.2: Mojave (10.14) and Catalina (10.15)

The gfortran component is dependent on the version of macOS being used.

For historical information about the toolchain, please see:
[R macOS toolchain evolution](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-macos-toolchain-evolution)

### INSTALL GUIDE

This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown of the actions required to setup
the toolchain. As a result, this guide will use both installers and script
commands via `Terminal.app` found in `/Applications/Utilities/`. `Terminal` is
macOS’ equivalent to Linux’s shell and Window’s command line. From Terminal,
we will install only the `XCode Command Line Tools` (“Xcode CLI”). These provide
the system headers used to build the official CRAN binary for R.

### XCODE COMMAND LINE TOOLS

There is a [video](https://youtu.be/Z01lzHNrSdU) available.

Here are the instructions:


1. Open the `Terminal` from `/Applications/Utilities/`

2. Type the following into Terminal

  - Note: **Anytime** the Xcode CLI toolchain updates, you
    must re-run this command.

    ```
xcode-select --install
Press “Install”
    ```
3. Press “Install”

4. Verify installation by typing into terminal:

    ```
gcc --version
    ```


### INSTALL OS-SPECIFIC GFORTRAN BINARY

Determine the version of macOS the computer is being run on.

1. Click the Apple menu  in the corner of your screen
2. Choose “About This Mac”
3. Look for Version `10.1*` or the name of the operating system.

For additional help in determining this, please see Apple’s support page on
[Find out which macOS your Mac is using](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260).

Then, download and install the appropriate gfortran binary from the [https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS)

- Mojave (10.14) - Catalina (10.15) uses gfortran8.2

  - [Download Link](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/download/8.2/gfortran-8.2-Mojave.dmg)
  
  - [GitHub Release Page Overview](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/8.2)

- Sierra (10.12) - High Sierra (10.13) uses `gfortran6.3`

  - [Download Link](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/download/6.3/gfortran-6.3-Sierra.dmg)
  
  - [GitHub Release Page Overview](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/8.2)


Both of the installers will place the gfortran binary into `/usr/local/gfortran`. This will be picked up by the default implicit variable set by R during compilation.

### QUICK CHECK

To verify that everything is working appropriately, let’s do a quick
`C++` program using `Rcpp` and `Armadillo`.

First, let’s install Rcpp and RcppArmadillo within R.

```
install.packages(c('Rcpp', 'RcppArmadillo'))
```

Create a new file, name the follow: `helloworld.cpp`

By adding the `.cpp` extension, the file is viewed as being `C++` code.

Within the file write:

```
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>   

// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void hello_world() {
  Rcpp::Rcout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;  
}

// After compile, this function will be immediately called using
// the below snippet and results will be sent to the R console.

/*** R
hello_world() 
*/
```

Compile the function using:

```
Rcpp::sourceCpp('path/to/file/helloworld.cpp')
```
where 'path/to/file/' is the location containing `helloworld.cpp`

If everything is installed appropriately, then you should see the following in the console:

```
> hello_world()

Hello World!
```

In addition, you should have a new function within the global
environment scope called “hello_world”. You can call this
function like a normal R function via:

```
hello_world()
```

### COMMON ERRORS

The following are debugged errors that you may run into.

```
clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-fopenmp'
fatal error: 'omp.h' file not found
```

Unfortunately, with R 4.0.0 the CRAN distributed version of R loses the ability to use OpenMP without a custom setup.
