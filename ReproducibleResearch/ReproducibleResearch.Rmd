# Help from the Barba Group

**The Lorena A. Barba group** has a helpful [Barbagroup reproducibility syllabus](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/barbagroup-reproducibility-syllabus/). It has a link to the **Reproducibility PI Manifesto** that she wrote while at BU and posted on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Reproducibility_PI_Manifesto/104539/1). The key points are:

1. I will teach my graduate students about reproducibility.
2. All our research code (and writing) is under version control.
3. We will always carry out verification and validation.
4. For main results in a paper, we will share data, plotting script & figure under CC-BY.
5. We will upload the preprint to arXiv at the time of submission of a paper.
6. We will release code at the time of submission of a paper.
7. We will add a "Reproducibility"" declaration at the end of each paper.
8. I will keep an up-to-date web presence. Corollary: I will develop a consistent open science policy.

Prof. Barba cites a helpful "Top-Ten" list taken from Sandve et al., [**Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research **](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) \ (2013).

1. For every result, keep track of how it was produced.
2. Avoid manual data-manipulation steps.
3. Archive the exact versions of all external programs used.
4. Version-control all custom scripts.
5. Record all intermediate results, when possible in standard formats.
6. For analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds.
7. Always store raw data behind plots.
8. Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected.
9. Connect textual statements to underlying results.
10 Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results.
