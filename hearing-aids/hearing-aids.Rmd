I work with Matt MacDonald at Dalzells, 10 South Pointe landing, Suite
150, Rochester NY, 14606, 585-227-0808.

I wear Phonac hearing Aids  (Phonak Bolero Q) purchased 2014-03-2014.
These still work reasonably well. The original cost of the two
hearing aids was $4610. They were model `Q70SP`. I got a ComPilot TV
link as well ($510 `S/N1409N 068C`). Total cost was $5425.

**Note**: It is important to clean the ear was away. use a q-tip and
blow out the tube (by mouth) occaionally...

Ted Fox recently got some new hearing aids that he says are much
better. These were `Phonak Audeom`. Ellie gave me part numbers
`312`, `312T`, `(3?)13T`.
